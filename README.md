## Project Description
Café Harmony, a new and exciting virtual café chain! The café specializes in offering a
variety of drinks, snacks, and light meals to customers. Over the past year, Café Harmony has seen
impressive growth but now faces new challenges as the company is scaling to meet customer
demand. The café has multiple locations across the city, each with its own performance metrics and
unique customer preferences. My job is to dive into the business data of Café Harmony, clean and analyze it, and ultimately
build a dashboard that will help the company's management make key decisions for growth.
### Business Introduction
Business Problem

Café Harmony has grown rapidly and now faces the challenge of improving its overall operational efficiency
and customer experience. The company needs to identify the following key business questions:

Which menu items are performing the best across different locations?

What is the customer profile that tends to spend the most (age, gender, or preferred product)?

How can the café improve its stock management to avoid running out of popular items while also reducing
overstock?

Are there any locations or employee performance issues that require attention?

### Aim Of this Project

My project aims to help Café Harmony make data-driven decisions by answering the business questions
listed above and presenting your findings in a clear, visually appealing dashboard.

The key objectives are:

1 Data Cleaning: Ensure all datasets are clean and ready for analysis.

2 Data Analysis: Use Excel formulas (like SUMIF, COUNTIF, VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH) to analyze
the data.

3 Dashboarding: Create a dashboard that visually communicates the answers to the business questions using
charts, pivot tables, and slicers.

4 Business Insights: Provide recommendations for business decisions based on the data insights.

## Problem Statement

Customers are highly dissatisfied, and products are constantly running low.

Why #1:
Why are customers dissatisfied?
Because the products they want are frequently out of stock.

Why #2:
Why are the products frequently out of stock?
Because inventory levels are not being replenished in time to meet customer demand.

Why #3:
Why is inventory not being replenished in time?

Because there is poor demand forecasting and supply chain planning.

Why #4:
Why is demand forecasting and supply chain planning poor?


Because the company lacks accurate sales data analysis and has no dynamic restocking system in place.

Why #5:
• Why is there no accurate data analysis or dynamic restocking system?


• Because there is insufficient investment in technology and process
improvement for inventory management.

## Root Cause

• Inadequate inventory management systems and lack of data-driven
  forecasting are causing product shortages,

• which in turn is driving customer dissatisfaction.

### RECOMMENDATIONS
- Implement inventory management software with real-time tracking
- Improve sales data analysis to better predict demand patterns.
- Establish automated restocking triggers based on minimum inventory
   thresholds.
- Train supply chain staff on demand forecasting techniques.
- Regularly review customer feedback to identify popular or high-demand
  products early.
